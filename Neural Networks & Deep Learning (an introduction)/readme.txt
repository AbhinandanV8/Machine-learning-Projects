# Neural Networks & Deep Learning
Course Introduction to Neural Network and Deep Learning

The project was accomplished by delivering 2 sub-projects. 
Part 1 deploys a neural network to build a regressor & classifier respectively for a communications equipment manufacturer. 
The model predicts the equipmentâ€™s signal quality using various parameters from its products, which is responsible for emitting informative signals. 

Part 2 delivers an image classifier, which can classify numbers from the photographs captured at street level using a Neural Network

Skills and Tools:-
Electronics and Telecommunication, Neural Networks, Deep Learning, TensorFlow, Image Recognition.
